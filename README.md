# Welcome to our Minishell!
Hey there, welcome to our Minishell project! ðŸŽ‰

This is a simplified shell program developed as part of the curriculum at the 42 School. The goal of this project is to recreate a basic Unix shell with features that mimic the behavior of a typical shell, while also offering the flexibility to extend it with custom commands and functionalities.

Minishell serves as a great exercise in system programming, process management, and working with signals, all within the context of Unix-based systems. Whether you're interested in learning how shells work under the hood or you're just looking for a fun project to play around with, Minishell has you covered!

#### Disclaimer for other 42 students
This project is intended to be a learning exercise for 42 students. Please do not copy, fork, or steal code from this repository to submit as your own. The aim of the project is to help you learn, not just complete the assignment. If youâ€™re stuck, work through the problem, ask for help, or discuss it with peers, but do not simply use other students' solutions. We believe in the value of learning through challenges, and thatâ€™s the only way youâ€™ll truly grow and succeed at 42. Letâ€™s keep it fair and fun!

# Installation & Setup
### Dependencies

The minishell program requires the following to compile and run:

- A Unix-like operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS)

- GNU Make

- GCC or Clang

- Readline library (for command-line input handling)

## Running Minishell with Docker Made Easy
If you do not want to deal with dependencies than using this link will be the easiest way to try
the minishell using [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
```sh
git clone https://github.com/atdeters/minishell.git && cd minishell && docker build -t msh . && docker run -it msh
```
**Note:**
The `alias-` (.msh_alias) and `history-` (.msh_history) files will not be stored when exiting and reopening this docker image. 
Use the following installation to try those features.

## One-Liner Installation Command
#### For Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential libreadline-dev && git clone https://github.com/atdeters/minishell.git && cd minishell && make
```
#### For MacOS (with Homebrew)
```sh
brew install readline && git clone https://github.com/atdeters/minishell.git && cd minishell && make
```

# Running the minishell program
Once compiled, start the shell with
```sh
./minishell
```
To run minishell in single-command mode run it with the `-s` flag.
It will execute the command and exit afterwards.
```sh
./minishell -s [command]
```
For displaying a usage file in the terminal run it with the `-h` flag
```sh
./minishell -h
```
